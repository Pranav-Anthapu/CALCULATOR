Read the equation. (String input = "..."

Create a stack to keep all the operands and operators in. 

While there are more inputs(number or operator) in the equation, run the while loop.{ 

	If the input is a number{ 
		push the input into the stack.
	}

	else{ 
	
		If it is multiplication/divison{ 
			Initialize a variable currentinput which is equal to the operator.
	
			Then read the next input as the next value in the equation being read. 

			Finally, initialize the previous input by popping the stack once.

			Do the calculation and push the answer into the stack.
		}
		If it is addition/subtraction{
			Push input in.
		}
	}
	
}
While the stack has more values{
	Pop operand from stack
	Pop operator from stack
	pop operand from stack
	Calculate with three values
	add answer to final output.
}

Print final output.
